# Occlusion Detection

## Introduction
Occlusion Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying occlusions in images. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze images and detect the presence of occlusions by evaluating various features.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Please note that this is a general list of dependencies; specific versions may be required for compatibility.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, install the required packages using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib

## Usage
Follow these steps to prepare your data and run the Occlusion Detection model:

1. **Data Preparation**: Organize your dataset into a suitable format for processing.
2. **Convert Labels**: Use one-hot encoding for the test data labels to match the model's output format.
3. **Model Construction**: Build your CNN model. This project provides a basic structure that you can customize.
4. **Compile the Model**: Compile your model with accuracy as the metric to evaluate its performance.
5. **Train the Model**: Run the training process with your dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on a test set to ensure its accuracy.
7. **Image Plotting**: Optionally, plot images to visualize the model's occlusion detection capabilities.

## Conclusion
Occlusion Detection offers a robust solution for identifying occlusions in images using advanced machine learning techniques. This project is open for further development and contributions are welcome.
